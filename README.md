# TrafficLights Project(Challenge)
TrafficLights Project as part of the In-tech-gration Workshop! In this project(challenge), I implemented different versions of traffic lights using React. 

- Greek TrafficLights without useState Hook: a traffic lights component manually managing state transitions without using the useState hook.

- Greek TrafficLights with useState Hook: a traffic lights component using the useState hook to manage state transitions.

- Greek Automatic TrafficLights with useState: automatic traffic lights that transition colors based on a timer using the useState hook.

- UK TrafficLights with useState: traffic lights following the sequence Red -> Orange -> Green -> Orange -> Red using the useState hook.
